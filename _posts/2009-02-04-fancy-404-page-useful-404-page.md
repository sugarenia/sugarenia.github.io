I&#8217;m gonna take (and use) my usability stick for this post, so please bear with me.

It seems everyone and her mother love a quirky, pretty 404 page these days. Tons of digital ink has been spent in <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/29/404-error-pages-one-more-time/" target="_blank">showcasing pretty 404 designs</a>, but how many of those are really what we could call a *useful* 404 page?

I&#8217;m certainly not the first to talk about useful 404 pages and I won&#8217;t be the last (plus, shhhh, my current 404 page sucks, the whole theme sucks basically but I promise I will get to it soon). <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/perfect404/" target="_blank">Others</a> have done this <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/amoreuseful404/" target="_blank">before me</a>, in a more clear and concise manner.

But somewhere along the road, we decided that the funnier or fancier a 404 page is, the greatest it is. It has almost become an inside joke between designers and we&#8217;ve lost our aim: to provide users with clear information on how to escape from that Internet dead-end. But funny is not always useful, people.

From the top of my head, here are some rules I remember for 404 pages:

*   Strip its design down to the basics, cut down anything that does not belong there. Your logo and main navigation will be fine, but that fancy sidebar? Not so.
*   Explain in a few words what led people there. Maybe a mistyped URL or a legacy link? Tell them what&#8217;s wrong. Don&#8217;t just 404 them. What the heck is 404 anyway?
*   Provide ways to return to your frontpage and / or contact pages. A search form could help the &#8220;search-first&#8221; people too.

So, in a nutshell: a <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/" target="_blank">lolcat</a> is not a proper way to greet users, however funny. A lolcat with a proper explanation, some &#8220;emergency exit&#8221; links and maybe a search form: *now* we&#8217;re talkin&#8217;.
