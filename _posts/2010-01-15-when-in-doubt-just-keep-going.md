You may or may not know this, but I&#8217;m a terrible wannabe overachiever.

When I start working on a project, I don&#8217;t just want it to succeed, I want it to be the *best*. I have visions of extended A+ reviews from fellow web designers and enthusiastic phone calls from clients, analytics pages that go really over the top and <del>thousands</del> millions of happy users.

Of course, all this fantasy gets me in trouble more often than not. I bet you know why: creative procrastination.

What does it mean, in a nutshell? I&#8217;ll visualize it for you: me, staring at the screen, pen & paper in hand, designing *in my mind*, laying out HTML snippets, styling with CSS, solving complex design problems, conducting usability reports and studying ROI analyses.

All. In. My. Head.

That&#8217;s a bit too much, as you know. It usually means that by the time I lay down a single line of CSS I&#8217;m so tired and confused it&#8217;s not even fun anymore. But I love my work, so it should be fun right? Right. That&#8217;s why you just need to **keep going**.

Every time you stumble upon a web design roadblock and lose two minutes of your precious time thinking of how to overcome it, stop and run in the opposite direction, immediately.

If you&#8217;re pondering too much over a design problem, do a bit of brain-dead form coding. If you&#8217;re totally bored of coding HTML, stop and sprinkle a bit of CSS magic to your project. If you feel confined in your browser window, fire up Photoshop and start designing out of the box. Most important: never stop working on your project. Less thought, more work.

I guarantee, a moment&#8217;s gonna come that your project will just look at you, shiny, finished, and you&#8217;ll marvel at how streamlined your process was this time.

&#8220;But, Sug, what about the correct way of web designing?&#8221;, I hear you thinking. As with most design workflows, t*here is really no spoon*. No panacea, no proper way of doing stuff. Hell, I always say &#8220;HTML first, CSS second&#8221; yet I always start coding CSS as soon as I get a vague idea of the site. Nasty, nasty Sug.

Learn your way of working and try to live with it. Don&#8217;t fret over the little things, they will eventually get ironed out before launch, promise.

Just don&#8217;t stop working.
