If you have any poor souls that are into <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a> (still) among your closest friends, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be already babbling about the new cool / addictive / annoying / you-name-it <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features/gameplay/achievements.xml" target="_blank">achievements system</a> that got introduced in the game with the <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/underdev/implemented/3p02.html" target="_blank">latest patch</a>.

Achievements is a simple idea from Blizzard, that uses the simple concept of rewarding users for completing quests, slaying monsters, exploring <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Azeroth" target="_blank">Azeroth</a>.

Its implementation is quite simple &#8211; there is an amount of achievements you can complete, each gives you &#8220;achievement points&#8221;, and some of them, because they require quite a bit of time and work, give you special rewards like titles and <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Tabard" target="_blank">tabards</a>. There is still no reward for getting achievement points.

So what&#8217;s so special about it?

<!--more-->

Nothing. But it turned every single WoW server upside down. Tons of people running around, doing silly stuff (some of the achievements are <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/World_Events_achievements#Hallow.27s_End" target="_blank">silly enough</a>), gathering achievement points &#8211; and for what?

For nothing (so far).

It&#8217;s quite interesting actually. Blizzard has invested in the players&#8217; addiction to getting as many points as possible, as quickly as possible &#8211; a viable asset in the MMORPG market. And it worked, oh how it worked.

It almost got me envious &#8211; how can Blizzard know so well its crowd? How can they make a game so addictive that justifies handing over 12 dollars per month for more than 4 years? Why are grown-ups, fathers and grandfathers hopping around when they get their latest achievement?

Now let&#8217;s move the metaphor to sites. Many sites already apply this technique to reward their users for contributing. Could such a method work in your user-based web service?

It well may. Some points, taken from Blizzard:

*   People love to measure their popularity, their credibility, their status. They don&#8217;t just need badges and levels of access &#8211; they need a solid number to boast and show off to other users. Provide them with that.
*   Give them constant clues as to how they can increase their status &#8211; it&#8217;ll both help you, as the designer of the service, and the users, since their profile will become more prestigious.
*   Add customization to the mix. One thing most users strive for, as soon as they reach a certain level of expertise, is customizing their online presence. Give them more and more options to do that, after achieving certain statuses. Make it mysterious, make it rewarding.
*   Don&#8217;t just design a rewards system and leave it &#8211; add to it, update it regularly, make users check it again and again for the latest trend.
*   Do not forget your initial goal &#8211; it&#8217;s not all about making the users happy, it&#8217;s about making the users happy while using your service in a productive way. Lure them to that.
