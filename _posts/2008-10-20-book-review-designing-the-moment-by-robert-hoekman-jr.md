Hoekman&#8217;s Designing the Obvious book <a href="http://blog.sugarenia.com/archives/web-design/book-review-designing-the-obvious-by-robert-hoekman-jr" target="_blank">in the past</a> &#8211; I must say I&#8217;m somehow biased, since I enjoy too much the way he writes. His books are simple and easy to follow and much focused &#8211; something that is a bit rare in the &#8220;Web Design&#8221; shelf, take my word for that.

&#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321535081?ie=UTF8&tag=sugareniacom-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0321535081" target="_blank">Designing the Moment: Web Interface Design Concepts in Action</a>&#8221; (as its full title goes) is no different. In this, mr. Hoekman touches most current web design aspects (or problems) and presents his take on how to design in a more effective but simpler manner.

Tag clouds, video players, forms, even the almighty (and common as hell) blog design gets tossed into Hoekman&#8217;s blender and gets out leaner and meaner. I agree with most of his points but not with all &#8211; that&#8217;s the beauty of it all, it&#8217;s like having a normal conversation with a fellow web designer, discussing the practical matters at hand. I like practical.

I can&#8217;t say if I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321535081?ie=UTF8&tag=sugareniacom-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0321535081" target="_blank">DtM</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032145345X?ie=UTF8&tag=sugareniacom-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=032145345X" target="_blank">DtO</a> best &#8211; they&#8217;re two different takes on the same problem. What I really liked in this was the fact that practical examples were given everywhere throughout the book. Did I say I love practical?

It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s short, and if you&#8217;re concerned about the best way to design things, it might get a special place in your bookplace. Give it a try.
