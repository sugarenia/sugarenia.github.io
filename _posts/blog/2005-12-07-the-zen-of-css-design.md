Finally, after the [well-known and much loved web site &#8211; project][1], the [book][2].

The [Zen of CSS design book][2] is, to put it mildly, one of the best books based on [CSS design][3] and [web standards][4]. It&#8217;s a must have for both amateur / hobbyists and advanced / professional web designers, since it combines great CSS tips and techniques with essential web design practices.

I bought it some weeks ago, and I must say that I had to restrain myself from reading it from cover to cover in just one session. A classy, elegant book graced by simple writing, easy and pleasant to read. 

Brilliant book from some great web professionals! ([Dave Shea][5] &#038; [Molly E. Holzschlag][6])

#### Things I Loved

*   The abundance of clear explanatory images which illustrate the book.
*   The numerous links to online resources which include some real gems.
*   The elegant and classy pages, subtle colours and typography which urges you to read the book.
*   The structure and division of content, which covers all major aspects of current web design.
*   The gazillion of creative ideas that spawn in your mind after reading just one section of the book.

#### Things I&#8217;m Sceptical About

*   The size of the book, a bit unpractical and uneasy.
*   The lack of actual guidance, since the book is a collection of hints &#8216;n&#8217; tips and not a hands-on tutorial. 
*   The language used may cause difficulties to non-native english speakers, in some parts.

As you too can see, it is difficult to spot any weak points in that book. It&#8217;s a must-have for any dedicated CSS fan, so if you&#8217;re into web standards, [go buy it now][7].
