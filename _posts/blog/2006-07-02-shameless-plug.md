I don&#8217;t really feel ok about this, but I think this is the ideal place for me to post it anyway.

As of this month, I started writing in the [greek edition][1] of [PC Magazine][2]. Two columns, based on Web 2.0 news and site reviews. You can check them at p. 36 &#038; 38 of the July issue.

Mr. [Stefanos Karagos][3] was the axis of this start, whom I thank dearly.

Other useful stuff in the [July issue][4]:

*   an exclusive cover of 11 GPS devices
*   42 notebooks on the test
*   Xbox 360 vs PC : which is the best for absolute gaming?

&#8230;and much, much more.

So go grab the greek PC magazine now! (and excuse me for advertising myself)
