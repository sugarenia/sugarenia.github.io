After many design iterations, bugs, mockups and mucho debate in our [Basecamp][1], <a href="http://www.css3.gr" target="_blank">CSS3.gr</a> is finally here.

An idea of <a href="http://www.porcupine.gr" target="_blank">Yiannis Konstantakopoulos</a>, amassing <a href="http://css3.gr/about" target="_blank">5 people</a> willing to explain Greece why standards is the one way to (online) enlightenment.

I was blessed (and cursed) with the design of it, took me ages, but I think it went pretty well overall. There are still some bugs here and there, some we know, some we know not, so <a href="http://css3.gr/contact" target="_blank">drop us a line</a> and tell us what doesn&#8217;t work for you.

We will not pretend we&#8217;re experts, we&#8217;re just learning just like everyone else. We&#8217;re just vocal about what we learn.

For all the non-greek speaking friends out there, sorry, the site is Greek-only. It was about time I got the chance to express myself in my mother tongue &#8211; as much as I despise some of its limitations.
