title: How I Force Myself to Be Productive (or else)

If you were around right now, you would see me hanging my head in shame. Why?

Because I&#8217;m a productivity junkie. *Of the worst sort*.

Name one productivity-related app or trick, I&#8217;ve tried it. Name one unorthodox time management method, I&#8217;ve been there.

Just a handful of tools fit my lifestyle & workflow. The reason is simple: most of them are so high maintenance I don&#8217;t even see the point of complicating my life so much just to feel productive.

Which are the three chosen ones, though? Without further ado, I give you the three that stuck™:

#### High-level Planning: The Hit List

<img class="alignnone size-full extruding wp-image-1388" title="thl" src="http://blog.sugarenia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thl.png" alt="" width="680" height="330" />

Ah, [The Hit List][1]. Elusive. Almost vapourware. So notorious but oh so good. It&#8217;s the only task management app that fits my workflow, even after all these years of testing productivity apps. Most Mac users swear by [Things][2], but I find it nowhere as flexible and easy to use as The Hit List (or THL, from now on, since there *is* a thing called carpal syndrome).

The main advantage of THL is that it doesn&#8217;t make you work in a specific way, instead it completely adapts to your needs. Are you looking for a simple list maker? Check. Are you a hardcore [GTD fan][3] that&#8217;s looking for the perfect tool for the job? Also check.

My favourite THL features are:

*   Infinite nesting of tasks. A task can have a subtask that can have a sub-subtask, ad infinitum. Seriously, Things, how hard can it be?
*   Any task you add can be &#8220;full-viewed&#8221; by pressing ⌘-2. BEST THING EVER. Any task, no matter how small, has a page where you can store stuff like text and links. I love this feature for quickly scribbling blog posts when inspiration hits.
*   The lovely sound effects when you complete tasks or hide completed tasks. So satisfying.
*   A special Today list that shows you all the stuff you have to do, well, today. It sounds trivial but it&#8217;s amazing how many task management apps get this wrong.
*   Keyboard shortcuts. I&#8217;m no Vim or Emacs maven, since my OCD makes me mad when an app has tons of shortcuts that I can&#8217;t possibly remember. THL shortcuts make so much sense though! Enter to add task, Space to complete, Tab to edit it, WASD to move it and/or nest it. Bliss!
*   It&#8217;s lightweight and (mostly) bug-free.

I have serious love for this app. I&#8217;ve also tried [OmniFocus][4] in the past, but *ohmigawd*, the amount of hoops you have to jump through just to &#8220;properly&#8221; add a task is too much for me. The Hit List is so simple there&#8217;s literally no learning curve.

#### Daily Planning: Desk Diary & Pen

<img class="alignnone size-full extruding wp-image-1391" title="moleskine" src="http://blog.sugarenia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/moleskine.png" alt="" width="680" height="330" />

One problem I always encounter while using task management apps is that most of them don&#8217;t have a decent way to add trivial, one-off tasks like &#8220;pay the bills&#8221; or &#8220;go to the gym&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want these tasks to clutter my precious todo list! No need to remember them. I know I have to do them but there&#8217;s no need to waste bytes for them.

That&#8217;s where my trusty [purple Moleskine diary][5] comes in. It&#8217;s a basic daily planner, one page per day.

In one of the myriad productivity posts I&#8217;ve bookmarked, I&#8217;ve read about a method of dividing a day page into your main areas, like home and work, and just add the relevant tasks to each context. No weird markup, no digital intervention, just scribbling a task list on a piece of paper using your favourite pen.

My diary (and most of them, I guess) has markings for the most common work hours, but I never use those to add time-specific tasks. I just divide the page into two sections: Home and Work (or Work and Home, in my case. I clearly have a priorities problem.) I then proceed to writing down my task list.

I gather all the one-off chores I need to do for the day as well as the work tasks I want to accomplish from my THL projects. I then start getting things done, crossing them as I go. If I don&#8217;t manage to finish a task, I add a circle around it to review it later, then I delegate it or tweak it to make it doable in the next workday. I try to accomplish at least 3 tasks daily for each area. On good days, my diary has about 5 items crossed off in each section &#8211; those are the days I go to sleep feeling content.

I&#8217;ve also been known to add tasks like &#8220;Read book X for 1 hour&#8221; to my Work list, or &#8220;Go out with friends&#8221; to my Home list. That&#8217;s because I have a major personality flaw: I&#8217;ll always wait till I finish everything I *have* to do before doing something I *want* to do. What this basically means is that, left unchecked, I can and will work myself to a pulp. I recently found out that adding fun stuff as todo items on my diary gives me the willpower to stop working and have fun.

Please tell me I&#8217;m not alone in this pathetic little club.

#### Time Management: Pomodoro

<img class="alignnone size-full extruding wp-image-1393" title="pomodoro" src="http://blog.sugarenia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pomodoro.png" alt="" width="680" height="330" />

We&#8217;ve all been there: having a minor but annoying task to finish but not finding the will to start working on it. Lo and behold, our good old friend procrastination knocks the door, bringing [funny cat .gifs][6] and [9gag][7] and self-pity.

That&#8217;s where [time blocking][8] comes in. There are various ways to implement time blocking, some of them quite fancy, but it essentially boils down to two things: you need a timer and the will to *finish that damn thing*.

My favourite time blocking method is Pomodoro. Its core idea is pretty simple: you work for 25 minutes, then you rest for 5 minutes. Every 1 hour, you give yourself a longer break of 15 minutes. Rinse and repeat. It fits my workflow perfectly because I&#8217;m very, *very* reward-driven. How hard can it be to work for 25 minutes, if you can harass your cat for the next 5 minutes?

To keep track of time, I use the [focus booster][9] Adobe Air app, just because it works just fine and I didn&#8217;t bother to do any more research. Of course, if you&#8217;re the analog kind, you can use your favourite kitchen timer, or your watch. Next step: find the annoying little bugger of a task you have to work on and press the button.

For this to work, I try to eliminate distractions like e-mail and Twitter. I give myself 25 minutes to work on the task and then a 5 minute break to walk around, check Twitter, do the dishes (it doesn&#8217;t sound like a reward, but after sitting on your butt all day, believe me it feels like one) or just goof around with my cat.

Bonus: if I keep doing light house chores during my breaks, after I finish work, my house is mostly clean as well! Double win!

#### Onwards and&#8230; upwards?

That&#8217;s my workflow, in a nutshell. If this helps you somehow, do let me know! And please share your tips, because clearly, all I need right now is to read another pile of productivity blog posts. Glee!
