I have a love/hate relationship with web design.

It&#8217;s what I like to do. When I first coded a website, looked at it and thought &#8220;hey, that&#8217;s nice&#8221;, I decided that&#8217;s what I wanted to do for a living. Even though I have a [Computer Science][2] degree and I&#8217;m lacking in graphic skills, I love learning about the basics of design through trial &#038; error.

On the other hand, empty Photoshop documents scare me to death. When a project starts and I have to start thinking out of the box, my mind shuts down. For a person as dependent on method and rules as I am, creativity is a huge struggle sometimes. I can prototype and wireframe a project&#8217;s ass off, but when it comes to design, I feel like a rabbit in front of headlights. So many possibilities!

Long story short, I get quite paranoid while designing a website. And I thought I should share it with you, dear readers.

Here are the phases I&#8217;m going through while designing:

#### 1st phase: Fear of the <del>dark</del> blank slate

Launch Photoshop. File > New. Stare at the screen till eyes feel tingly. Shut down Photoshop and open WoW. Play till eyes bleed.

#### 2nd phase: GTD

I&#8217;m feeling quite guilty at the moment, so I usually break up the design process in itsy little steps and enter them in [OmniFocus][3]. I start working on the first todo, typically &#8220;Launch Photoshop&#8221;. Something fancy gets my attention on Twitter. 90 minutes and 12 clicks later, I launch Photoshop and create a new document.

#### 3rd phase: Procrastination

I start translating my wireframes to .psd talk. Typically, that means that I just copy my wireframe to Photoshop, trying as hard as possible to avoid any kind of creative thinking at this point. I obsess over grey boxes and alignment, till I remind myself the finished result will hopefully not look anything like it. I try to switch my mind to creative mode.

#### 4rd phase: Guilt

By now, quite some time has passed and I&#8217;ve got nothing to show. I turn to the web for inspiration. It dawns to me: every web designer out there is more productive and creative than me! Every single link I click on is a nightmare. There&#8217;s a devil on my shoulder whispering &#8220;See how well she&#8217;s done it? And in so little time? Try to beat THAT&#8221;.

#### 5rd phase: Denial

This is the worst phase, both for me and the people around me. I become moody and unapproachable. I answer to questions with grunts. I mope around the house, wearing pj&#8217;s and eating trash food. I&#8217;m convinced I&#8217;m a fraud, that I somehow managed to cheat people into thinking I&#8217;m a designer. No colour scheme works, Photoshop tools give me hell, I can&#8217;t even draw a straight line. I sometimes cry. I sometimes have fits. All in all, I behave like a brat.

#### 6th phase: Spark

While browsing every website from [Dribbble][4] to [Youporn][5] [NSFW obviously / but safe for MY work / mwahahaha / yeah.] and squeezing my mind trying to come up with *something*, I see it. My spark. My inspiration igniter. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a full website, it can be a background or a button or a textured line. The world shifts, everything clicks into place, a feeling of warmth inside me tells me: *Everything&#8217;s gonna be alright*.

#### 7th phase: Execution

That&#8217;s where the real design happens. I form a bubble around my design. I&#8217;ve been known to talk to myself during this phase &#8211; things like &#8220;Oh I know! It&#8217;ll look *exactly* like this&#8221; are occasionally heard in Casa Sugar. I design like there&#8217;s Devil hot on my tail. Sometimes I forget to breathe. Double rainbows all across the sky, unicorns fetch me sandwiches and I keep wondering &#8220;Gee, how could I question myself? I&#8217;m a great designer&#8221;. Yeah, modesty doesn&#8217;t really work in this phase.

#### 8th phase: Delivery

[Save for Web|Archive]. Fire up Gmail. Attach &#038; send.

And this happens every. Single. *Time*.

If that&#8217;s not a love/hate relationship, I don&#8217;t know what is.
