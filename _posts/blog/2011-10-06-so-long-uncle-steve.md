Today is just another ordinary day.

My (and his™) iPhone alarms went off at 8am, but I woke up half an hour later because I couldn&#8217;t sleep properly last night. Despite the insomnia, I was in a pretty good mood, humming softly while I brushed my teeth and got into my running shorts. I made sure I had a 30-min run today by taking a glimpse in my [miCoach][1] schedule on the iPhone and briefly checked my e-mail.

I was pulling my hair up in a ponytail when he™ got in the bathroom and told me the news.

I rushed to my iMac to find my Twitter stream exploding. I briefly scrolled through the messages while plugging my iPhone to sync some new songs from my iTunes running mix. Closed the iPhone 4S tab that I was checking out last night, as well as the keynote (is it called now a Timnote?) presentation from the iPhone event. I opened up [Apple.com][2]. Then [Wired.com][3]. Then [Google.com][4].

I typed some half-assed tweet in my Apple keyboard and shuffled around my Macbook Pro to find my sunglasses and my iPhone armband. While running, I was thinking how cool would be if we could use Siri on our Macs. Surely it&#8217;d be amazing to tell Siri create an appointment in iCal while I&#8217;m typing in an article in Pages&#8230;

Today is just another ordinary day.
