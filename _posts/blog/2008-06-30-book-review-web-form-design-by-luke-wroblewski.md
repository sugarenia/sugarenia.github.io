EDIT: Mr. Rosenfeld was kind enough to offer a discount code for all Sugarenia.com readers: with the code **SUGARENIA** you get **-10%** while purchasing <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/publications/" target="_blank">any of their books</a>. Now is the time to get them, guys!

At first, I was kinda hesitant to go on and buy such a niche book &#8211; after all, what&#8217;s so exciting about coding and designing web forms?

*Wrong*.

Mr. <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/" target="_blank">Wroblewski</a>&#8216;s book taught me that web forms are all kinds of designer fun, and this is not a euphemism. It&#8217;s just what the author says:

> Forms make or break the most crucial online interactions: checkout, registration, and any task requiring information entry.

Imagine how many times you decided not to join a service just because of its scary registration form &#8211; or how many times you&#8217;ve mistakenlyÂ filled in your credit card number to a checkout form that didn&#8217;t support multiple formats of input.

Get the point?

<a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/web_form_design.asp" target="_blank">Web Form Design</a> is a simple, well-written book: it seems to have borrowed the blogging way of stating facts, and this is a good thing: simple, coherent writing, to-the-point explanations and the ubiquitous &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; list of points in the end of each chapter strike a chord: it&#8217;s a specialized blog turned book! That&#8217;s not too bad, is it?

<a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/web_form_design.asp" target="_blank">Web Form Design</a> by <a href="http://www.lukew.com" target="_blank">Luke Wroblewski</a> is a book highly recommended for interface designers, both on web and more traditional media. It can help everyone that wants to improve her skills in laying out inputs and textareas, and make you feel good too in the meanwhile.

You surprised me, mr. Wroblewski. Pleasantly, I might say. I think I&#8217;ll get <a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/site_seeing.html" target="_blank">Site Seeing</a> too.
