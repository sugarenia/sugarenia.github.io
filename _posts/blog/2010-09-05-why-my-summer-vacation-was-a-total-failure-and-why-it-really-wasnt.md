This month, I officially celebrate my first 6 months as a freelancer. Surprisingly enough, one of the reasons I quit my day job and went the self-employed route was because I wanted to work *less*, not more. I don&#8217;t want to get rich sacrificing my personal life. I just want to achieve a balance.

So this year, I&#8217;ve done the unthinkable: I gave myself a *full month* of vacation time. August is a (really) slow month in Greece anyway, since temperatures have the bad habit of raising to and beyond 30C (~90F). Surely not an appropriate environment for slaving in front of a text editor.

The moment my vacation started, I thought I was in heaven &#8211; one full month without commitments, apart from a 9-day trip to UK? You&#8217;re kidding me, right? I felt like a schoolgirl again.

However, these idyllic days now belong to the past. As any good thing (insert horrible clich√© here), they&#8217;re history. And I find myself struggling to get back to work, starting one of my favourite months of the year.

So what have I learnt from this one-month sabbatical? I keep reminding myself these three things:

*   When you&#8217;re busy making plans, life is busy passing by. Stop making plans. Never stop doing things and having fun.
*   There&#8217;s never enough procrastination. You&#8217;ll never bore yourself surfing the shiny &#8216;nets. It&#8217;s in your hands to put an end to your ever-worsening ADHD.
*   Don&#8217;t leave any &#8220;someday/maybe&#8221; plans for your vacation. Vacation time should strictly be time off. Your body won&#8217;t let you work anyway.

I was planning to finish my portfolio page this month. Liven up my blog. Work on various personal projects. Improve my web design knowledge and practice.

Instead, what have I done? Nothing really. Read about 9 fiction books, walked around most of London, got a slight tan, went to a kickass beach party and visited relatives &#038; family. Also started a [tiny vidcast][1]. And that&#8217;s it.

Will I try this prolonged vacation again? Most probably, yes. Maybe even more. But I&#8217;ll start my future vacation thinking about what I won&#8217;t do and not about what I&#8217;ll do. 

That&#8217;s always a more realistic point of view, I think.
