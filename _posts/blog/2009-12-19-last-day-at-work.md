Yesterday was one of the most *emotional* and *surreal* days of my life.

Surreal enough to get me writing again.

After three years of work and some months of preparation, I quit my job at [Phaistos Networks][1].

It&#8217;s been a real pleasure to work with the great people there. I&#8217;ve gained friends I could not hope for. I&#8217;ve learned more stuff that can fit my tiny brain. And I&#8217;ve got the kind of precious experience that comes from working with [really talented people][2] that are passionate about what they do, at all times.

Needless to say (and as much of a stuck-up bitch I seem at times), things got pretty emotional. I&#8217;ll miss working there, but it was time for me to go on.

A new path, exciting as well as totally terrifying, unfolds now in front of me.

Expect that in the next few months, you&#8217;ll see some more of me.

Stay tuned.
