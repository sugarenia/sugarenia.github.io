<img class="left" title="The Hit List by PotionFactory" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/3103704073_76547b468e_t.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" />One of the newest kids on the productivity (or as all the cool kids call it, [GTD][1]) field is [The Hit List][2], a polished task management app from [PotionFactory][3], the mama of [Voice Candy][4] and [Tangerine!][5].

Having used (for just a bit) a ton of task management apps, both on Windows and on Mac OS, I can tell if one of those buggers is gonna be a hit or not. And this, my friends, is a direct cross√© to the jaw of procrastination.

[Things][6]? I never quite got used to it. Sounds illogical, but it never managed to fit my workflow. I didn&#8217;t like the way it handled tasks and projects and &#8216;areas&#8217;, plus it stayed in beta phase for too long.

[OmniFocus][7]? I would *love* it. If I was [Merlin Mann][8]. I&#8217;m a quite simple-minded girl and OF was just too much for me.

[iGTD][9]? Anything with &#8220;todo&#8221; somewhere in their name? You name it, I&#8217;ve tested it. Nothing worked. So I&#8217;ve settled with [TaskPaper][10] and all its simple-text, cross-platform goodness. I use it everyday for simple lists, but I wanted an application to keep track of greater projects and complex to-dos. Enter [The Hit List][2].

It&#8217;s sexy (even in its public beta incarnation), it&#8217;s pleasant to use, it makes you wanna do things, cross them off your list and then add some more (actually, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a very good side-effect, but whatever).

What I loved:

*   Getting around using *only the keyboard*. I cannot remember myself ever learning all the shortcuts of an application, but I&#8217;ve quickly mastered THL ones. It even has a &#8216;game mode&#8217;, where you can move tasks around with W, A, S, D. Support for vi and emacs text shortcuts included. <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/" target="_blank">Quicksilver</a>-like &#8220;Go To&#8230;&#8221; functionality. What&#8217;s not to love?
*   *Nested tasks*. Yes, at lasts, a task is not just a single action, it&#8217;s a tree. Thank you.
*   *Tabbed view*, so handy and *card view*, which lets you focus on one task alone, adding notes at will. Perfect for brainstorming.
*   When you finish a task, a pleasant sound greets you. That is one of the things that makes you wanna complete more and more. Excellent work in visual and aural cues.
*   The overall level of polish, given the fact that it&#8217;s still in beta (I cannot get over Things prohibiting me from dragging stuff to the sidebar).

I have heard many people comparing The Hit List to Things, but this is like comparing your sexy new girlfriend to your interesting-looking, but pyjama-wearing ex. Yes, THL is a polished task management app like Things, but fares better in almost everything in my starry eyes.

Be sure to [download it][11] and give it a go if you&#8217;re into it. And check the default *Learn The Hit List* project for more insight.
