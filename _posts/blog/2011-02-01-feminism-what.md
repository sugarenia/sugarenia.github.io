Last night, while I was walking towards home, a stranger felt up my *derrière*.

Thought you misread? Let me rephrase: while I was returning home last night from my weekly trip to [Stelios][1]&#8216; place for our [podcast][2], a random man on a scooter approached me, slowed down, grabbed my bum and drove away.

Here I was, thinking about wireframes and workflows and a Mac app, when suddenly I felt a hand on my ass.

What. The. Fuck.

My first (and only) reaction was shock. I just stood there, totally speechless, and watched him leaving without as much as a shout.

At first I thought I was stupid for not screaming. Then I thought, maybe it was someone I know. But then, I don&#8217;t keep grab-yo-bum relationships with anyone apart the boyfriend™, and even he wouldn&#8217;t dare to do that in plain sight, while I&#8217;m walking alone at night.

Then I realized what happened. And I felt like *shit*.

Do you know what&#8217;s worse? I momentarily felt guilty. I thought &#8211; hey, maybe my jeans were hanging too low. Maybe they were too tight. Maybe I moved too much while walking, do I do that really? I must stop it, then, it&#8217;s provocative. That stupid female remorse that&#8217;s wired in our brains.

I&#8217;m not big on feminism and I&#8217;ve been quite vocal about it. I think it creates a huge divide between the two genders that&#8217;s uncalled for. If we, women, want to be treated as equals, we have to start behaving like we are. The whole thing seems a bit whiney to me.

But one jackass in a motorcycle helmet managed to lessen me and my big mouth to pulp.

That *prick*.

<small>The subject is touchy. Therefore I won&#8217;t tolerate jokes in the comnents. In fact &#8211; screw it, I&#8217;m closing them off completely for this post only.</small>
