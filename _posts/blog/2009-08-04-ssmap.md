Today marks the start of a new venture in content generation for me. A [podcast][1].

Me and best friend and geek accomplice [Stelabouras][2] decided to share our chaotic conversations with all of you, so we gave this duo podcast a try. It&#8217;s called *Sugarenia & Stelabouras Make a Podcast* but we&#8217;ll excuse you if you use [SSMaP][3], really. It sounds cooler anyway.

It was fun to record and very quick (was having second thoughts about podcasting time but it&#8217;s not that bad after all, especially if Stelios is taking all the editing weight). It&#8217;s in greek, sorry international friends. It covers a wide range of geekery, from social media to apple fanboyism, MMOs and whatever goes. We&#8217;ll try and keep a weekly schedule, there&#8217;s no shortage of cool news around for sure, but it&#8217;s not strict.

One thing is certain: we liked the response and we&#8217;ll do it again.

Enjoy.
