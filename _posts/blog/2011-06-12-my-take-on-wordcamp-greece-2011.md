About two months ago, I was invited by Basilis Kanonidis of [creativeg.gr][1] to speak in the second greek WordCamp, which would take place in Thessaloniki in early June.

At first, I reacted as I always react to new challenges: I won&#8217;t be good at it. I won&#8217;t know what to talk about. I will stutter and lose my train of thought. An ACME anvil will fall from the sky right on top of my head. You know, it&#8217;s a cruel thing, sabotaging yourself, but I&#8217;m trying to get over it. 

Then I realised, there *is* something I want to talk about, something that disturbed me every time I checked the WordPress premium themes marketplace. So I forced myself to steer clear of procrastination and work on this idea, and soon realised I really, really liked working on it after all. Plus, I&#8217;d get to visit beautiful Thessaloniki again after 11 years and have fun with some dear friends! What more to ask for?

Skip to 4th June morning. 

Mild pre-presentation stress. Rehearsing the slides in my mind while brushing my teeth. Arrived early with [Thanos][2], so we had the chance to <del datetime="2011-06-12T07:40:34+00:00">break some glasses</del> socialise a bit more. Marveled at the weird Thessaloniki weather &#8211; scorching heat, cloudy and then, pouring rain? Wow.

Then the event started, Basilis gave us an intro and [Dimitris][3] hopped on stage to talk about what he loves more, blogging. Since I was second in the speaking schedule, I tried to focus on what Dimitris was saying without worrying about that ACME anvil &#8211; I think I succeeded. 

Then, it was my turn. And I talked about this:

<div style="width:510px" id="__ss_8243408">
  <strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sugarenia/wordcamp-greece-2011" title="Wordcamp Greece 2011">Wordcamp Greece 2011</a></strong> <div style="padding:5px 0 12px">
    View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sugarenia">Zaharenia Atzitzikaki</a>
  </div></p>
</div>

(I hope it makes sense without my presenter notes. If not, leave a comment and we can discuss it over e-mail.)

Phew, done! I think it went well. Worry-free now, I sit comfortably to watch the next presentations.

[Apostolos][4] gave us some hints on [good theme design practices from a blogger&#8217;s viewpoint][5]. [Thanos][2] talked to us about [typography][6] (and his project [WireframePlus][7] &#8211; do YOU know what WireframePlus does?), [Vasilis][8] gave a very informative presentation on [using WordPress as an advanced CMS][9], [Gerasimos][10] introduced us to the [pros and cons of WordPress frameworks][11], [Fotis][12] decided that merging CodeIgniter and WordPress would be fun so he told us to go for it, [Basilis][13] showed us how easy it&#8217;d be to [setup a mini social network using BuddyPress][14], while George Kanellopoulos from Microsoft gave two presentations, on [WordPress &#038; Microsoft Web Platform][15] and [on HTML 5][16] that I&#8217;m sure many found interesting.

It was excellent. 

I love the vibe of this kind of events &#8211; many savvy people in a room, talking about what they like best and socializing, networking, having plain stupid fun. If I changed one thing, it&#8217;d be the fact that I didn&#8217;t talk with as many people as I wanted to, as I&#8217;m kinda shy &#8211; next time, if you see me around drop by and say hi!

These two days were such a welcome break from my routine &#8211; walking around the city discovering places (and ruining my feet &#8211; damn you, strappy sandals), having good food, being lazy in Navarinou Square, gazing at the lovely Roman Forum view from our hotel window, walking by the sea, all lovely and a great start to my summer.

Thanks to everyone involved and special thanks to Thanos, Yiannis, Gerasimos and Eleni for showing us around the city. You rock, peeps.

Here&#8217;s to a great third WordCamp next year!
